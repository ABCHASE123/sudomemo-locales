# sudomemo-locales
For public contributions to localization efforts on Sudomemo.

Notes: In some headers, text is shrunk by prepending an @ sign. As English text displays differently in the Japanese versions, and vice-a-versa, @ signs at the beginning of a locale string should not be included in the translated versions unless added after the fact.

## How to contribute

Fork this repository. Please use your **master** branch rather than making additional branches, as your master branch is what will be pulled into the main repository. 

Copy the en_US folder to a new folder.

Please name the folder as follows: ISO-639 language code concatenated with the ISO-3166 country code by an underscore. 

For example:

en_US = English (USA)

ja_JP = Japanese (Japan)

el_GR = Greek (Greece)

For Spanish, please use

es_ES - Spanish (Spain).

If you have any question about what to name your locale folder, feel free to reach out to me on Discord (sudofox#8048) or on Twitter ( https://twitter.com/Sudomemo )
