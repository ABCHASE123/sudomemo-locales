# sudomemo-locales
For public contributions to localization efforts on Sudomemo.

Notes: In some headers, text is shrunk by prepending an @ sign. As English text displays differently in the Japanese versions, and vice-a-versa, @ signs at the beginning of a locale string should not be included in the translated versions unless added after the fact.

## English->Japanese efforts:

The following list is not up-to-date and will be updated shortly to reflect the current state of translations. 	

### Out of date (untranslated or partially untranslated)


### In need of review by someone fluent in Japanese  
- All Pages

### Up-to-Date Pages (full translation set - reviewed by someone fluent in Japanese)
